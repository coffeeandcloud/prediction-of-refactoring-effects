The success of machine learning relies heavily on the amount and quality of dataset the algorithm was trained on. This is true not only for analyzing source code repositories but all learning strategies in general. At the the same time, the generation and extraction of suitable data is often based on a manual process which is costly and time-consuming. While getting the data for other machine learning settings is often difficult, the process of mining of software repositories benefits from GitHub as one of the most important data sources and therefore has a high ability to be automated.\\
