	abstract="Power consumption is becoming more and more important with the increased popularity of smart-phones, tablets and laptops. The threat of reducing a customer's battery-life now hangs over the software developer, who now asks, ``will this next change be the one that causes my software to drain a customer's battery?'' One solution is to detect power consumption regressions by measuring the power usage of tests, but this is time-consuming and often noisy. An alternative is to rely on software metrics that allow us to estimate the impact that a change might have on power consumption thus relieving the developer from expensive testing. This paper presents a general methodology for investigating the impact of software change on power consumption, we relate power consumption to software changes, and then investigate the impact of OO software metrics and churn metrics on power consumption. We demonstrated that software change can effect power consumption using the Firefox web-browser and the Azureus/Vuze BitTorrent client. We found evidence of a potential relationship between some software metrics and power consumption. We also investigate the effect of library versioning on the power consumption of rTorrent. In conclusion, we investigate the effect of software change on power consumption on two projects; and we provide an initial investigation on the impact of software metrics on power consumption.",

pages="673--690",
abstract="The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and tolerance are both widely used measures of the degree of multi-collinearity of the ith independent variable with the other independent variables in a regression model. Unfortunately, several rules of thumb -- most commonly the rule of 10 -- associated with VIF are regarded by many practitioners as a sign of severe or serious multi-collinearity (this rule appears in both scholarly articles and advanced statistical textbooks). When VIF reaches these threshold values researchers often attempt to reduce the collinearity by eliminating one or more variables from their analysis; using Ridge Regression to analyze their data; or combining two or more independent variables into a single index. These techniques for curing problems associated with multi-collinearity can create problems more serious than those they solve. Because of this, we examine these rules of thumb and find that threshold values of the VIF (and tolerance) need to be evaluated in the context of several other factors that influence the variance of regression coefficients. Values of the VIF of 10, 20, 40, or even higher do not, by themselves, discount the results of regression analyses, call for the elimination of one or more independent variables from the analysis, suggest the use of ridge regression, or require combining of independent variable into a single index.",

We investigate facets of CPS complexity and the limitations of Collaborating Information Processing Systems (CIPS) in dealing with those facets. By CIPS we refer to teams of humans and computer-aided engineering systems that are used to develop CPS. Furthermore, we specifically analyze characteristic differences among software and physical parts within CPS. The analysis indicates that it will no longer be possible to rely only on architectures and skilled people, or process and model/tool centered approaches. The tight integration of heterogeneous physical, cyber, CPS components, aspects and systems, results in a situation with interfaces and interrelations everywhere, each requiring explicit consideration. The role of model-based and computer aided engineering will become even more essential, and design methodologies will need to deeply consider interwoven systems and software aspects, including the hidden costs of software.",

abstract="Mutation analysis is a well-studied, fault-based testing technique. It requires testers to design tests based on a set of artificial defects. The defects help in performing testing activities by measuring the ratio that is revealed by the candidate tests. Unfortunately, applying mutation to real-world programs requires automated tools due to the vast number of defects involved. In such a case, the effectiveness of the method strongly depends on the peculiarities of the employed tools. Thus, when using automated tools, their implementation inadequacies can lead to inaccurate results. To deal with this issue, we cross-evaluate four mutation testing tools for Java, namely PIT, muJava, Major and the research version of PIT, PITRV, with respect to their fault-detection capabilities. We investigate the strengths of the tools based on: a) a set of real faults and b) manual analysis of the mutants they introduce. We find that there are large differences between the tools' effectiveness and demonstrate that no tool is able to subsume the others. We also provide results indicating the application cost of the method. Overall, we find that PITRV achieves the best results. In particular, PITRV outperforms the other tools by finding 6{\%} more faults than the other tools combined.",

In practice, generating tests only for one specific criterion may not be sufficient when testing object oriented classes, as standard structural coverage criteria do not fully capture the properties developers may desire of their unit test suites. For example, covering a large number of statements could be easily achieved by just calling the main method of a class; yet, a good unit test suite would consist of smaller unit tests invoking individual methods, and checking return values and states with test assertions. There are several different properties that test suites should exhibit, and a search-based test generator could easily be extended with additional fitness functions to capture these properties.",

Ideally, developers would have a system that predicts whether a given commit is likely to impact performance and suggests which tests to run to detect a potential performance regression. Prior approaches towards this problem require static or dynamic analyses that limit their generality and applicability. This paper presents an approach that is simple and general, and that works surprisingly well for real applications.</p>

abstract="Many real-world search and optimization problems are naturally posed as non-linear programming problems having multiple objectives. Due to the lack of suitable solution techniques, such problems were artificially converted into a single-objective problem and solved. The difficulty arose because such problems give rise to a set of trade-off optimal solutions (known as Pareto-optimal solutions), instead of a single optimum solution. It then becomes important to find not just one Pareto-optimal solution, but as many of them as possible. This is because any two such solutions constitutes a trade-off among the objectives and users would be in a better position to make a choice when many such trade-off solutions are unveiled.",

abstract="In the context of testing of Object-Oriented (OO) software systems, researchers have recently proposed search based approaches to automatically generate whole test suites by considering simultaneously all targets (e.g., branches) defined by the coverage criterion (multi-target approach). The goal of whole suite approaches is to overcome the problem of wasting search budget that iterative single-target approaches (which iteratively generate test cases for each target) can encounter in case of infeasible targets. However, whole suite approaches have not been implemented and experimented in the context of procedural programs. In this paper we present OCELOT (Optimal Coverage sEarch-based tooL for sOftware Testing), a test data generation tool for C programs which implements both a state-of-the-art whole suite approach and an iterative single-target approach designed for a parsimonious use of the search budget. We also present an empirical study conducted on 35 open-source C programs to compare the two approaches implemented in OCELOT. The results indicate that the iterative single-target approach provides a higher efficiency while achieving the same or an even higher level of coverage than the whole suite approach.",

abstract="Testability transformation is a new form of program transformation in which the goal is not to preserve the standard semantics of the program, but to preserve test sets that are adequate with respect to some chosen test adequacy criterion. The goal is to improve the testing process by transforming a program to one that is more amenable to testing while remaining within the same equivalence class of programs defined by the adequacy criterion. The approach to testing and the adequacy criterion are parameters to the overall approach. The transformations required are typically neither more abstract nor are they more concrete than standard ``meaning preserving transformations''. This leads to interesting theoretical questions. but also has interesting practical implications. This chapter provides an introduction to testability transformation and a brief survey of existing results.",
