\label{sec:assessment}

\subsection{Experimental Settings}
\label{sec:method}
The \emph{goal} of the study is to provide a preliminary assessment of the performance of the proposed framework, with the \emph{purpose} of understanding its potential usefulness for the data extraction stage of machine learning approaches. More specifically, we seek to understand computational time ... Hence, we pose the following research question:

\begin{center}
	\begin{examplebox}
		\textbf{RQ$_1$.} \emph{To what extent can \iris improve the computational time with respect to a single-threaded baseline?}	
	\end{examplebox}
\end{center}

\textbf{Context selection.} The \emph{context} of the study is composed of the version history of the systems reported in Table \ref{tab:systems}. The selection process is driven by...
